# Contributing Presets

## Recommendations

- **Please ensure that your "Render - DirectX11 Renderer - Global style overrides - Minimum Fill Alpha" setting is set to 0, and "Maximum Fill Alpha" is set to 255 while you are creating a preset. Otherwise, your presets may end up looking really not well for others!**
- It's recommended to paint "unsafe" areas rather than "safe" areas, even if the unsafe areas are significantly bigger.
- Any layout that does not uses explicit names or the game's log lines (Splatoon's log lines are fine) can be marked as **[International]** right away.
- Please include a brief description with your preset if it does something more than just displaying unsafe zones. If a mechanic can be resolved in a few different ways and you're resolving it in a specific way (e.g. usinga specific guide from YouTube), please include the strategy's name and/or a link to a guide or screenshot.
- If you're shipping elements that are disabled by default, please include an explanation so users will know when they should enable them.
- Please consider using uniform layout group names across all layouts for a duty.
- If a few layouts can be combined together to form a uniform preset and it does not makes sense to import them separately, you can include them into a single code block with one layout per line.

## Freezes

- **Refreeze interval** is the cooldown for another freeze to happen if all of the same conditions are still met for that element.
- **Freeze for** is how long the element will display.
